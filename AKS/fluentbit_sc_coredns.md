## FROM CHATGPT-4 

In Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), CoreDNS is typically pre-installed as part of the managed Kubernetes service. To configure Fluent Bit as a sidecar for log collection within this setup, you need to adapt the approach by ensuring you don’t disrupt the existing CoreDNS deployment managed by AKS. Instead, you can deploy a separate Fluent Bit daemon or sidecar in a way that doesn't interfere with the managed components.

Here's an adapted approach for AKS:

### Step 1: Create Fluent Bit ConfigMap
First, prepare a `ConfigMap` that includes the Fluent Bit configuration, focusing on tailing the logs that Kubernetes outputs (since you won’t modify the CoreDNS deployment directly).

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: fluent-bit-config
  namespace: kube-system
data:
  fluent-bit.conf: |
    [SERVICE]
        Flush        1
        Log_Level    info
        Parsers_File parsers.conf

    [INPUT]
        Name              tail
        Path              /var/log/containers/*coredns*.log
        Parser            docker
        Tag               kube.*
        Refresh_Interval  5
        Skip_Long_Lines   On

    [FILTER]
        Name                kubernetes
        Match               kube.*
        K8S-Logging.Parser  On
        K8S-Logging.Exclude Off

    [OUTPUT]
        Name   stdout
        Match  *

  parsers.conf: |
    [PARSER]
        Name        docker
        Format      json
        Time_Key    time
        Time_Format %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%L
        Time_Keep   On
        # Keys are adjusted based on Kubernetes log format

### Step 2: Deploy Fluent Bit as a DaemonSet
Since modifying the CoreDNS pods directly isn’t recommended in AKS, deploy Fluent Bit as a DaemonSet so it automatically deploys to each node and can access logs from CoreDNS pods running on those nodes.

Create a DaemonSet definition in a file named `fluent-bit-daemonset.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: fluent-bit
  namespace: kube-system
  labels:
    k8s-app: fluent-bit-logging
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      name: fluent-bit
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: fluent-bit
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: fluent-bit
      tolerations:
      - key: "node-role.kubernetes.io/master"
        effect: NoSchedule
      containers:
      - name: fluent-bit
        image: fluent/fluent-bit:latest
        volumeMounts:
        - name: varlog
          mountPath: /var/log
        - name: config-volume
          mountPath: /fluent-bit/etc
      volumes:
      - name: varlog
        hostPath:
          path: /var/log
      - name: config-volume
        configMap:
          name: fluent-bit-config
```

### Step 3: Create Necessary Roles and Service Accounts
Ensure that the Fluent Bit DaemonSet has the necessary permissions to access log paths and Kubernetes APIs:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: fluent-bit
  namespace: kube-system

---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: fluent-bit
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods", "namespaces"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]

---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: fluent-bit
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: fluent-bit
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: fluent-bit
  namespace: kube-system
```

### Step 4: Deploy Everything to AKS
Deploy all these resources to your AKS cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f fluent-bit-configmap.yaml
kubectl apply -f fluent-bit-daemonset.yaml
kubectl apply -f fluent-bit-rbac.yaml
```

### Step 5: Monitor Logs
To see the logs being collected by Fluent Bit:

```bash
kubectl logs -f [POD_NAME] -n kube-system -c fluent-bit
```

This setup ensures that Fluent Bit is collecting logs from CoreDNS without modifying its default deployment in AKS, maintaining compatibility and supportability with Azure's managed Kubernetes offerings.
